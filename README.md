# WooCommerce Auto Approve Vendors
Simply approves product vendors upon registration for new users or those who already have an account.

### How do I set the user role the vendors will get once approved?

By default the user role will be set to Vendor Admin. If you wish to change it to Vendor Manager then simply use this filter `woocommerce_auto_approved_vendors_role` and change the value to the vendor manager role.

#### Vendor Roles
* Vendor Admin   - `wc_product_vendors_admin_vendor` – Has access to all settings.
* Vendor Manager - `wc_product_vendors_manager_vendor` - Has limited access to the Vendor dashboard.
